The TerminusDB schema language enables documents and their relationships to be specified using simple JSON syntax. This syntax makes it as easy as possible to specify a JSON object to automatically convert to a graph. This approach enables data to be viewed as collections of documents or as knowledge graphs of interconnected objects.

## Schema Objects

A JSON object in TerminusDB schema is composed of **key-value** pairs. There are two main types of schema objects, one `@context` typed schema object, and different kinds of structures, including the following:

- **Class**:definitions for document and subdocument instances
- **Enum**: definitions for enum values
- **Foreign**: definitions for foreign IRI references (arbitrary IRIs)
- **TaggedUnion**: definitions for tagged union types (one of property definitions)

Each of the above types of schema objects has a `@type` property with the value of the type, and several other definition keywords as described next.

### Key

A key is one of two values, **keyword** or **property**, described in the table below. The full schema definition is a stream or list of these values or JSON objects.

#### Table: Types of keys

{%table%}

- Key type
- Example
- Description

---

- **keyword**
- `@id`
- Starts with `@`, has a value with a special meaning.

---

- **property**
- `name`
- Does not start with `@`, has a value with a **range** type.

{%/table%}

Property names beginning with `@` (at-sign) are reserved for TerminusDB schema definition language keywords such as `@id`, `@type`, `@key`, `@base`, `@schema`, `@context`, `@inherits`, `@documentation`, `@subdocument`, `@abstract`, `@unfoldable`, `@metadata`, `@inherits`, `@oneOf`.

## Class definition

The basic unit of specification is a **class**. A class definition is a schema object with the keyword `@type` with type value `Class`. The keyword `@id` specifies the name of the class. The example below define a class named `Person` with a property `name` of type `xsd:string`. See [Data Types](/docs/data-types/) for a complete reference of all supported types.

#### Code: The basic unit of specification

```json
{
    "@type": "Class",
    "@id": "Person",
    "name": "xsd:string"
}
```

## Context object

The **context object** is a special schema object affecting the entire schema. The context object is specified by the special `@type` value `@context`. An example:

#### Code: The context object

```json
{   "@type"            : "@context",
    "@schema"          : "http://terminusdb.com/schema/woql#",
    "@base"            : "terminusdb://woql/data/",
    "xsd"              : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "@documentation"   :
    {
        "@title"       : "WOQL schema",
        "@authors"     : ["Gavin Mendel-Gleason"],
        "@description" : "The WOQL schema providing a complete specification of the WOQL syntax.
                         This enables:
                         * WOQL queries to be checked for syntactic correctness.
                         * Storage and retrieval of queries.
                         * Queries to be associated with data products.
                         * Helps to prevent errors and detect conflicts in merge of queries.",
    }
}
```

This example does the following:

- Defines default prefixes in `@schema` and `@base` to use for the schema and data.
- Defines the prefix `xsd` enabling vocabulary based on different URL prefixes.
- For example, specify `xsd:string` to denote `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string`
- Documents the schema in the `@documentation` value, providing:
- `@title`
- `@authors`
- `@description`

### Context Prefixes

All properties in the context object that do not start with `@`, such as `xsd`, are URI definitions. They must be of the form shown below. Prefix and URI are defined by their respective regular expressions. That is, a prefix has an identifier starting with an alphabetic character followed by alphanumeric characters. The URI has a protocol followed by valid URI characters. Each prefix is paired with a URI.

```text
Prefix := ":alpha::alphaNum:*"
URI    := ":alpha:alphaNum:*://:uriChar:*"

{   ...
    Prefix : URI
    ... }
```

### Context Keywords

A list of keywords used in the context object.

#### @schema

The `@schema` keyword specifies the default URI expansion to use for all elements of the schema. In the example below, the class name `NamedQuery` expands to `http://terminusdb.com/schema/woql#NamedQuery`.

#### Code: Context keyword @schema

```json
{
    "@type"       : "@context",
    "@schema"     : "http://terminusdb.com/schema/woql#",
    "@base"       : "terminusdb://woql/data/"
}
{
    "@id"         : "NamedQuery",
    "@type"       : "Class",
    "@key"        :
    {
        "@type"   : "Lexical",
        "@fields" : [ "name" ]
    },
    "name"        : "xsd:string",
    "query"       : "Query"
}
```

### @base

`@base` specifies the default URI expansion used for all elements of instance data. In the previous schema definition, and given the document in the instance graph example below, the id `NamedQuery_my_query` expands to `terminusdb://woql/data/NamedQuery_my_query`.

#### Code: How `NamedQuery_my_query` expands to `terminusdb://woql/data/NamedQuery_my_query`

This is an instance document in the instance graph.

The `@id` property is used to specify the id, the subject of the document, which identifies it uniquely in the graph.

The context for all instance graph documents is specified in the context object of the schema graph:

- The `@base` is defined in the `@context` schema object
- The `@context` schema object is defined in the schema graph (see above)
- The `@base` is defined to be `terminusdb://woql/data/`.
- Therefore, `NamedQuery_my_query` expands to `terminusdb://woql/data/NamedQuery_my_query` IRI during processing.

A custom `@base` can be defined for a type that overrides the default `@base` value.

```json
{
    "@type": "NamedQuery",
    "@id": "NamedQuery_my_query",
    "name": "my_query",
    "query": {
        "@type": "True"
    }
}
```

### @documentation

`@documentation` specifies documentation global to the entire schema. See the `@documentation` section in the previous context object example. The `@documentation` tag can be a single value, or it can be a list with each element having an additional `@langugage` tag. The `@language` tag must have an IANA language code, and this will be used to select appropriate descriptions when internationalising the schema.

The documentation section contains the keywords:

### @title

The `@title` of the schema to display.

### @description

A long-form `@description` of the purpose of the schema, the type of documents contained in the schema, and keywords useful for searching for the type of content that the schema encodes.

### @authors

A list of strings of `@authors` involved in writing the schema.

### @metadata

If you would like to add arbitrary JSON structured metadata to a the `@context` object of schema, you can place it in the `@metadata` field of the context object. This can be used to store metadata information for the branch or data product in a structured format.

An example of metadata for a branch, such as `main` of a data product:

```json
{
    "@type": "@context",
    "@base": "http://my_stuff/",
    "@schema": "http://my_schema#",
    "@metadata": { "configuration": { "frob": 29 } }
}
```

### @language

If you use the `@language` code, specific documentation results can appear in different circumstances depending on the users language preferences.

An example of the `@language` tag for a context is as follows:

```json
{
    "@base": "terminusdb:///data/",
    "@schema": "terminusdb:///schema#",
    "@type": "@context",
    "@documentation": [
        {
            "@language": "en",
            "@title": "Example Schema",
            "@description": "This is an example schema. We are using it to demonstrate the ability to display information in multiple languages about the same semantic content.",
            "@authors": ["Gavin Mendel-Gleason"]
        },
        {
            "@language": "ka",
            "@title": "მაგალითი სქემა",
            "@description": "ეს არის მაგალითის სქემა. ჩვენ ვიყენებთ მას, რათა ვაჩვენოთ ინფორმაციის მრავალ ენაზე ჩვენების შესაძლებლობა ერთი და იმავე სემანტიკური შინაარსის შესახებ.",
            "@authors": ["გავინ მენდელ-გლისონი"]
        }
    ],
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
}
```

## Document structure definition keywords

A document definition includes several properties, and the keywords, prefixed `@`, describing class behavior.

### @type

The `@type` of the object. At the schema level, this is one of: `Enum`, `Class`, `TaggedUnion`, `Foreign` and `Unit`. Classes can be subdivided into document classes and subdocument classes, where only document classes can be instantiated.

### @metadata

If you would like to add arbitrary JSON structured metadata to a class, you can place it in the `@metadata` field of the class. This can be used to direct various approaches to display of the class, or associated information for backend or front-ends which may have different requirements.

It is generally good practice to keep important metadata one level deeper in a JSON object so as to leave space for other kinds of metadata. For instance:

```json
{
    "@type": "Class",
    "@id": "MyClass",
    "@metadata": { "display_format": { "colour": "Blue", "size": [100, 400] } },
    "name": "xsd:string"
}
```

#### De facto class metadata: Render as Markdown

To instruct the client to render properties as Markdown, which enables users to curate data using a Markdown editor, specify `render_as` and the property in the `@metadata` field.

Generally, it is a recommendation to populate the `render_as` with a mime-type, such as `text/markdown` or `text/plain` (for plain text) for any other uses than the originally envisioned "markdown".

The example below shows a document with the ID `People` with the `desc` string property set to render as Markdown:

```json
{
        "@id": "People",
        "@type": "Class",
        "@metadata": {
            "render_as": {
                "desc": "markdown"
            }
        },
        "desc": {
            "@class": "xsd:string",
            "@type": "Optional"
        },
        },
        "name": {
            "@class": "xsd:string",
            "@type": "Optional"
        },
        "gender": {
            "@class": "xsd:string",
            "@type": "Optional"
    }
```

#### De facto class metadata: Order By

You can specify the order of properties within your schema so that it is displayed in the document explorer in an order specified by you. Using `order_by` in the `metadata` field in square brackets, list the property order you want, for example:

```json
{
        "@id": "People",
        "@type": "Class",
        "@metadata": {
            "order_by": [
                "name",
                "hair_color",
                "eye_color",
                "gender",
                "birth_year"
            ],
        },
...
```

## Class schema type

`Class` designates a standard class document. It contains the definition of several properties and keywords describing various class attributes.

Classes comes in two types: document classes, and subdocument classes. Document classes can be instantiated, while subdocument classes cannot. Subdocuments enable the ability to describe data structures in a documents, frame by frame.

An example of a class, and then instance of the class below.

#### Code: An example of a class

```json
{
    "@id": "Dog",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@base": "Dog_",
    "@key": {
        "@type": "Lexical",
        "@fields": ["name"]
    },
    "name": "xsd:string",
    "hair_colour": "Colour"
}
```

#### Code: An example of a class instance

```json
{
    "@type"       : "@context",
    "@base"       : "http://i/",
    "@schema"     : "http://s#"
}
{
    "@type"       : "Dog",
    "@id"         : "Dog_Cerberus",
    "name"        : "Cerberus",
    "hair_colour" : "Grey"
}
```

## Enum schema type

An `Enum` is a non-standard class in which each instance is a simple URI with no additional structure. To be a member of the class, you must be one of the referent URIs. An `Enum` example with an extension `Blue` is s shown below. In the database, the actual URI for an Enum is expanded with the preceding type name, so the `blue` extension becomes `http://s#PrimaryColour/blue`

#### Code: An example of an enum class

```json
{
    "@type": "Enum",
    "@id": "PrimaryColour",
    "@value": ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
}
```

## TaggedUnion schema type

A `TaggedUnion` specifies mutually exclusive properties. This is useful when there is a disjoint choice between options.

Examples below of a schema with a TaggedUnion and a concrete TaggedUnion class extension. In these examples, the `BinaryTree` class specifies a `TaggedUnion` enabling a choice between a `leaf` (with no value), or a `node` class with a value and branches.

#### Code: An example schema with a TaggedUnion

```json
{
    "@type"     : "@context",
    "@base"     : "http://i/",
    "@schema"   : "http://s#"
}
{
    "@id"       : "BinaryTree",
    "@type"     : "TaggedUnion",
    "@base"     : "binary_tree_",
    "@key"      :
    {
        "@type" : "ValueHash"
    },
    "leaf"      : "sys:Unit",
    "node"      : "Node"
}
{
    "@id"       : "Node",
    "@type"     : "Class",
    "@key"      :
    {
        "@type" : "ValueHash"
    },
    "value"     : "xsd:integer",
    "left"      : "BinaryTree",
    "right"     : "BinaryTree"
}
```

#### Code: An example TaggedUnion class extension

```json
{
    "@type": "Node",
    "value": 0,
    "left": {
        "@type": "BinaryTree",
        "leaf": []
    },
    "right": {
        "@type": "BinaryTree",
        "leaf": []
    }
}
```

See also `@oneOf` in the class definition that is similar to `TaggedUnion`.

## Foreign schema type (foreign references)

Use `Foreign` to specify types that are to be references to external data products. Foreign types are types that are opaque in the current data product. This allows us to give them identifiers although we don't actually store the objects locally. Foreign types have _no_ referential integrity checking, and as they refer to opaque identifiers, the schema is checked by the data product in which they are referred.

A foreign type must be declared explicitly by giving the name of the type to be treated as foreign using the `Foreign` designation in the schema.

Foreign references is in essence a specialization of the `xsd:anyURI` type, where Foreign are stored in one succinct auto-indexing data structure with fast lookup references to a URI reference to any external data product or RDF knowledge graph subject.

#### Code: An example of adding a foreign Person type

For instance, to add a foreign type of type Person, we can write:

```json
{ "@type": "Foreign", "@id": "Person" }
```

The actual definition of person might be given in its home data product as:

```json
{
    "@type": "Person",
    "@key": { "@type": "Lexical", "@fields": ["name "] },
    "name": "xsd:string"
}
```

And to use a field with an optional `Person` foreign field, this is how to define the property, just like any other reference, using the `@class`.

```json
  "person": {
    "@class": "Person",
    "@type": "Optional"
  }
```

#### Code: An example creating and referring to a foreign type

From the command line we can see how an HR data product might interact with an Events data product.

Create the HR data product:

```bash
terminusdb db create admin/hr
```

Add the HR schema:

```bash
echo '{ "@type" : "Class", "@id" : "Person", "@key" : { "@type" : "Lexical", "@fields" : ["name"]}, "name" : "xsd:string" }' | terminusdb doc insert admin/hr --graph_type=schema
```

Create the Events data product:

```bash
terminusdb db create admin/events
```

Add events, and a foreign type designation:

```bash
echo '{ "@type" : "Foreign", "@id" : "Person"}{ "@type" : "Class", "@id" : "Event", "date" : "xsd:date", "person" : "Person" }' | terminusdb doc insert admin/events --graph_type=schema
```

Add a person to HR:

```bash
echo '{ "@type" : "Person", "name" : "Gavin" }' | terminusdb doc insert admin/hr
```

Add an event referring to the person:

```bash
echo '{ "@type" : "Event", "date" : "2022-10-05", "person" : "terminusdb:///data/Person/Gavin"}' | terminusdb doc insert admin/events
```

Recover the event:

```bash
terminusdb doc get admin/events --id='Event/9b3c5b174cb1f157dcdcedb692ed57f82ba31193fb81652dc602915732ae94e1'
```

## Class definition details

### @id

The `@id` key of a class defines the class name and identifier. The name uniquely defines the class, enabling the class to be updated, retrieved, and deleted. In the example below, the class is named `NamedQuery`. It does not have a fully qualified URL or prefix, so it is implicitly based on the URI given for `@schema`.

#### Code: The @id key of a class

```json
{
    "@id": "NamedQuery",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@key": {
        "@type": "Lexical",
        "@fields": ["name"]
    },
    "name": "xsd:string",
    "query": "Query"
}
```

### @key

`@key` specifies the mechanism to define the `@id` of documents in the database, similar to a primary key in relational database terms. Valid key types are `Lexical`, `Hash`, `ValueHash`, `Random`.

If the key `@base` is specified in the class, then this is pre-pended to the key. If this is a fully qualified URI then it is complete, otherwise, it is combined with the value of `@base` from the context.

#### Lexical

A `Lexical` key specifies a URI name formed from a URI encoded combination of all `@fields` arguments provided, in the order provided. An example is shown below. With this key type (or key strategy) a URI is formed from the combination of `first_name` and `last_name`. If `@base` is specified in the class, this is prepended.

Given the [simple document definition](#codeasimpledocumentdefinition) below, this will either generate (if `@id` is not supplied) or check that the URI `http://example.com/people/Person_Hasdrupal_Barca` is the `@id` element.

#### Code: An example Lexical key

```json
{
    "@type"         : "@context",
    "@schema"       : "http://example.com/people#",
    "@base"         : "http://example.com/people/"
}
{
    "@id"           : "Person",
    "@type"         : "Class",
    "@base"         : "Person_",
    "@key"          :
    {
        "@type"     : "Lexical",
        "@fields"   :
        [
            "first_name",
            "last_name"
        ]
    },
    "first_name"    : "xsd:string",
    "last_name"     : "xsd:string",
    "year_of_birth" : "xsd:gYear"
}
```

#### Code: A simple document definition

```json
{
    "@type": "Person",
    "first_name": "Hasdrupal",
    "last_name": "Barca",
    "year_of_birth": "-245"
}
```

#### Hash

`Hash` is generated in the same way as `Lexical` except that values are first hashed using the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

Use this where there:

- Are numerous items that form the key making the URI unwieldy.
- Is no need for the URI to inform the user of the content of the object.
- Is a requirement that data about the object is not be revealed by the key.

Define a `Hash` in the same way as the [Lexical key strategy](#codeanexamplelexicalkey) example in the previous section, replacing the `@key` `@type` value from `Lexical` to `Hash`.

Given the [simple document definition](#codeasimpledocumentdefinition) in the previous section, the `@id` `Person_5dd7004081e437b3e684075fa3132542f5cd06c1` is generated.

#### ValueHash

The `ValueHash` key generates a key defined as the downward transitive closure of the directed acyclic graph from the root of the document. This means you can produce a key that is entirely based on the entire data object. Note `ValueHash`:

- Takes no additional keywords.
- Objects must be directed acyclic graphs, they **cannot be cyclic**.

In the example below, `ValueHash` is formed only from the value of `layer:identifier`.

#### Code: An example ValueHash key

```json
{
    "@id": "layer:Layer",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@documentation": {
        "@comment": "A layer object which has the identifier used in storage.",
        "@properties": {
            "layer:identifier": "The layer identifier."
        }
    },
    "@base": "layer_data:Layer_",
    "@key": {
        "@type": "ValueHash"
    },
    "layer:identifier": "xsd:string"
}
```

#### Random

Use `Random` as a convenient key type when an object has no important characteristics that inform a key or does not need to be constructed such that it is reproducible. In the example below, the `@key` `@type` is defined as `Random`, meaning each new database that is added is unique regardless of label.

#### Code: An example of a Random key

```json
{
    "@id": "UserDatabase",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@documentation": {
        "@comment": "A normal user database.",
        "@properties": {
            "label": "The label name of the database.",
            "comment": "A comment associated with the database.",
            "creation_date": "The time of creation of the database.",
            "state": "The system transaction state of the database."
        }
    },
    "@inherits": "Database",
    "@key": {
        "@type": "Random"
    },
    "label": "xsd:string",
    "comment": "xsd:string",
    "creation_date": "xsd:dateTime",
    "state": "DatabaseState"
}
```

### @documentation

Use `@documentation` to add documentation to the class and the property fields or values of the class. The `@documentation` can either be an object, or a list of objects with specified languages (and at most one default unspecified). An example using multiple languages might be:

```json
{
    "@id": "Example",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@documentation": [
        {
            "@label": "Example",
            "@comment": "An example class",
            "@properties": {
                "name": {
                    "@label": "name",
                    "@comment": "The name of the example object"
                },
                "choice": {
                    "@label": "choice",
                    "@comment": "A thing to choose"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "@language": "ka",
            "@label": "მაგალითი",
            "@comment": "მაგალითი კლასი",
            "@properties": {
                "name": {
                    "@label": "სახელი",
                    "@comment": "მაგალითის ობიექტის სახელი"
                },
                "choice": {
                    "@label": "არჩევანი",
                    "@comment": "რაც უნდა აირჩიოთ"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "name": "xsd:string"
}
```

The keywords of the `@documentation` object are `@comment` and either `@properties` or `@values` for standard classes or `Enums` respectively. Each of the `@properties` or `@values` can likewise have either a simple label, or an object with `@label` and `@comment (as above)`.

For `Enum` we can write as follows:

```json
{
    "@id": "Pet",
    "@type": "Enum",
    "@documentation": {
        "@comment": "What kind of pet?",
        "@values": {
            "dog": "A doggie",
            "cat": "A kitty"
        }
    },
    "@value": ["dog", "cat"]
}
```

For a standard `Class` with one default language, we can write as follows:

```json
{
    "@id": "Person",
    "@type": "Class",
    "@documentation": {
        "@comment": "Information about people",
        "@values": {
            "name": "The persons name",
            "friends": "The kinds of company someone keeps"
        }
    },
    "name": "xsd:string",
    "friends": {
        "@type": "Set",
        "@class": "Person"
    }
}
```

#### @comment

The `@comment` is the class description.

#### @properties

The `@properties` keyword is a JSON object with pairs of the form:

```json
{
    "property_1" : "description_1",

    ...

    "property_n" : "description_n"
}
```

or with properties pointing to JSON objects, as:

```json
{
    "property_1" : { "@label" : "description_1", "@comment" : "comment_1" },

    ...

    "property_n" : { "@label" : "description_2", "@comment" : "comment_2" }
}
```

### @base

`@base` specifies a prefix to prepare to the `@key`. This prefix is absolute if `@base` is a fully qualified URI, otherwise, it will, in turn, be prefixed by the system-wide `@base` definition. In the example below, the `@base` for the class is fully qualified after the `layer_data` prefix is expanded. This means the layer URIs have the form `terminusdb://layer/data/Layer_` followed by a random string.

#### Code: An example of the @base keyword

```json
{
    "@type"            : "@context",
    "@documentation"   :
    {
        "@title"       : "The Ref schema",
        "@description" : "This is the Ref schema. It gives a specification for storage of references, branches and commits in our commit graph.",
        "@authors"     :
        [
            "Gavin Mendel-Gleason",
            "Matthijs van Otterdijk"
        ]
    },
    "@base"            : "terminusdb://ref/data/",
    "@schema"          : "http://terminusdb.com/schema/ref#",
    "layer"            : "http://terminusdb.com/schema/layer#",
    "layer_data"       : "terminusdb://layer/data/",
    "xsd"              : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
}
{
    "@id"              : "layer:Layer",
    "@type"            : "Class",
    "@documentation"   :
    {
        "@comment"     : "A layer object which has the identifier used in storage.",
        "@properties"  :
        {
            "layer:identifier" : "The layer identifier."
        }
    },
    "@base"            : "layer_data:Layer_",
    "@key"             :
    {
        "@type"        : "ValueHash"
    },
    "layer:identifier" : "xsd:string"
}
```

### @subdocument

The `@subdocument` key is present with the value `[]` or it is not present.

A class designated as a sub-document is considered to be completely owned by its containing document. It is not possible to directly update or delete a subdocument, but it must be done through the containing document. Currently, subdocuments **must have a key** that is `Random` or `ValueHash` (this restriction may be relaxed in the future.)

See below for examples of a subdocument declaration in a schema, and a corresponding subdocument.

#### Code: An example subdocument declaration

```json
{
    "@type"        : "@context",
    "@base"        : "terminusdb://i/",
    "@schema"      : "terminusdb://s#"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Person",
    "age"          : "xsd:integer",
    "name"         : "xsd:string",
    "address"      : "Address"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Address",
    "@key"         :
    {
        "@type"    : "Random"
    },
    "@subdocument" : [],
    "country"      : "xsd:string",
    "postal_code"  : "xsd:string",
    "street"       : "xsd:string"
}
```

#### Code: An example subdocument

```json
{
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "doug",
    "name": "Doug A. Trench",
    "address": {
        "@type": "Address",
        "country": "Neverlandistan",
        "postal_code": "3",
        "street": "Cool Harbour lane"
    }
}
```

### @abstract

The `@abstract` key is present with the value `[]` or it is not present.

An abstract class has no concrete referents. It provides a common superclass and potentially several properties shared by all of its descendants. Create useful concrete members using the `@inherits` keyword.

An example of the abstract keyword in a schema, and a concrete instance of the `Person` class, but not of the `NamedEntity` class:

#### Code: An example of the abstract keyword

```json
{
    "@type"     : "@context",
    "@base"     : "terminusdb://i/",
    "@schema"   : "terminusdb://s#"
}
{
    "@type"     : "Class",
    "@abstract" : [],
    "@id"       : "NamedEntity",
    "name"      : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@type"     : "Person",
    "@id"       : "Person",
    "@inherits" : ["NamedEntity"]
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "doug",
    "name": "Doug A. Trench"
}
```

### @inherits

`@inherits` enables classes to inherit properties (and the `@subdocument` designation) from parent classes. It does **not** inherit key strategies.

This inheritance tree is also available as a `subsumption` relation in the WOQL query language and provides semantics for **frames** in the **schema API**.

The range of `@inherits` can be a class or a list of classes. For example:

```json
{
    ...,

    "@inherits" : "MyClass",

    ...
}
```

Or

```json
{
    ...,

    "@inherits" :
    [
        "MyFirstClass", "MySecondClass"
    ]

    ...
}
```

#### Multiple inheritance

Multiple inheritance is allowed as long as all inherited properties of the same name have the same range class. If range classes conflict, the schema check fails.

Both document and subdocument classes observe the same inheritance rules for properties of the class. The inheritance model is a directed acyclical graph, DAG, including multiple inheritance of properties to support both property mix-in and taxonomy-style classifications. Read more about inheritance further below.

An example of inheritance of properties and an object meeting this specification:

#### Code: An example of inheritance

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "RightHanded",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "right_hand" : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@id"        : "LeftHanded",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "left_hand"  : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@id"        : "TwoHanded",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@inherits"  :
    [
        "RightHanded", "LeftHanded"
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "TwoHanded",
    "@id": "a two-hander",
    "left_hand": "Pretty sinister",
    "right_hand": "But this one is dexterous"
}
```

### @unfoldable

The `@unfoldable` key is present with the value `[]` or it is not present.

In the document API, when retrieving documents, the default behavior is for any linked document to be returned as an IRI, while subdocuments are fully unfolded and returned as a nested document. With the `@unfoldable` option set, linked documents will behave just like subdocuments, and will also be unfolded on retrieval.

The purpose of `@unfoldable` is to be able to treat linked (top-level) documents as subdocuments in representation. Subdocuments can only be linked by one document, its owner, whereas normal documents can be linked by any number of other documents. If the desired result is to have a document linked by several other documents, but still have it fully unfolded on retrieval like a subdocument, use this option.

#### Cycle detection

The `@unfoldable` option can be set on any class. Fields with unfoldable class fields may even link back directly or indirectly, forming cycles.

Self-referencing documents are prevented from being unfolded infinitely by cycle detection. When a cycle is present, the recurring leaf will not be unfolded and instead be represented by its IRI. The same behavior is applied when a document has too many unfolds, going beyong the configurable default of 500.000 documents.

Read more about cycle detection in the [TerminusDB Internals](/docs/terminusdb-internals/), in the section [Document Unfolding Reference](/docs/document-unfolding-reference/).

#### Code: An example unfoldable

```json
{
    "@type"        : "@context",
    "@base"        : "terminusdb://i/",
    "@schema"      : "terminusdb://s#"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Person",
    "name"         : "xsd:string",
    "address"      : "Address"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Address",
    "@unfoldable"  : [],
    "country"      : "xsd:string",
    "postal_code"  : "xsd:string",
    "street"       : "xsd:string"
}
```

#### Code: an example set of documents

```json
{
    "@type"        : "Address",
    "@id"          : "Address/1",
    "country"      : "Neverlandistan",
    "postal_code"  : "3",
    "street"       : "Cool Harbour lane"
}

{
   "@type"         : "Person",
   "@id"           : "Person/doug",
   "name"          : "Doug A. Trench",
   "address"       : "Address/1"
}

{
   "@type"         : "Person",
   "@id"           : "Person/phil",
   "name"          : "Phil A. Trench",
   "address"       : "Address/1"
}
```

The above example shows both Doug and Phil using the same address document. On retrieval of all Persons, the document API returns these documents:

```json
{
    "@type"        : "Person",
    "@id"          : "Person/doug",
    "name"         : "Doug A. Trench",
    "address"      : { "@type"       : "Address",
                       "@id"         : "Address/1",
                       "country"     : "Neverlandistan",
                       "postal_code" : "3",
                       "street"      : "Cool Hasrbour lane" }
}
{
    "@type"        : "Person",
    "@id"          : "Person/phil",
    "name"         : "Phil A. Trench",
    "address"      : { "@type"       : "Address",
                       "@id"         : "Address/1",
                       "country"     : "Neverlandistan",
                       "postal_code" : "3",
                       "street"      : "Cool Hasrbour lane" }
}
```

The address is fully unfolded in both documents despite not being a subdocument.

### @unfold (field-level)

The `@unfold` annotation can be applied to individual properties within a class definition, providing fine-grained control over which linked documents are automatically expanded during retrieval.

Unlike class-level `@unfoldable` which applies globally to all references to a class, field-level `@unfold` allows different properties pointing to the same class to have different unfolding behavior.

#### When to use field-level @unfold

- A reusable class should be unfolded in some contexts but not others
- Different properties pointing to the same class have different unfolding requirements
- The target class is from an external schema that cannot be modified

#### Syntax

Add `"@unfold": true` to any complex property definition (Optional, Set, Array, List, or Cardinality):

```json
{
    "@type": "Class",
    "@id": "Order",
    "customer": {
        "@type": "Optional",
        "@class": "Customer",
        "@unfold": true
    },
    "product": {
        "@type": "Optional",
        "@class": "Product"
    }
}
```

In this example, when retrieving an Order document:

- `customer` will be unfolded inline (full Customer object)
- `product` will remain as an ID reference

#### Interaction with @unfoldable

| Class `@unfoldable` | Property `@unfold` | Behavior            |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| No                  | No                 | Return ID reference |
| No                  | Yes                | Unfold inline       |
| Yes                 | No                 | Unfold inline       |
| Yes                 | Yes                | Unfold inline       |

Field-level `@unfold` enables unfolding for properties referencing non-unfoldable classes. When the target class is already marked `@unfoldable`, the field-level setting has no additional effect.

#### Cycle detection

Cycles are allowed in schemas using field-level `@unfold`. At runtime, TerminusDB uses ancestor path tracking to detect cycles during document retrieval. When a cycle is detected, the recurring document is represented by its ID instead of being unfolded again, preventing infinite recursion.

For example, if Document A references Document B which references Document A again, the result will be:

```json
{
    "@id": "A",
    "ref": {
        "@id": "B",
        "ref": "A"
    }
}
```

#### Code: An example with field-level @unfold

```json
{
    "@type"        : "@context",
    "@base"        : "terminusdb://i/",
    "@schema"      : "terminusdb://s#"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Customer",
    "name"         : "xsd:string",
    "email"        : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Product",
    "name"         : "xsd:string",
    "price"        : "xsd:decimal"
}
{
    "@type"        : "Class",
    "@id"          : "Order",
    "orderNumber"  : "xsd:string",
    "customer"     : {
        "@type"    : "Optional",
        "@class"   : "Customer",
        "@unfold"  : true
    },
    "items"        : {
        "@type"    : "Set",
        "@class"   : "Product"
    }
}
```

When retrieving an Order:

```json
{
    "@type": "Order",
    "@id": "Order/123",
    "orderNumber": "ORD-123",
    "customer": {
        "@type": "Customer",
        "@id": "Customer/alice",
        "name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
    },
    "items": ["Product/widget", "Product/gadget"]
}
```

The `customer` is fully unfolded while `items` remain as ID references.

See also the [Document Unfolding Reference](/docs/document-unfolding-reference/) for more details on cycle detection and performance characteristics.

### @oneOf in a Class definition

The `TaggedUnion` is a special case and syntactic sugar for the more general case of collections of disjoint properties. These more complex cases can be represented by inheriting from a number of `TaggedUnion`s, but they may also be given explicitly using the `@oneOf` field, together with a Class.

The value of the `@oneOf` field is a set, so can be any number of documents all of which have mutually disjoint properties, but which can coexist. Examples with more than one disjoint property are given below.

#### Code: An example schema with @oneOf

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s#"
}
{
    "@id"        : "IntOrString",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@oneOf"     :
    {
        "integer": "xsd:integer",
        "string" : "xsd:string"
    }
}
{
    "@id"        : "Friend",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@key"       :
    {
        "@type"  : "Lexical",
        "@fields": ["name"]
    },
    "name"       : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Toy",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@key"       :
    {
        "@type"  : "Lexical",
        "@fields": ["name"]
    },
    "name"       : "xsd:string"
}
{
    "@id"       : "Pet",
    "@type"     : "Class",
    "name"      : "xsd:string",
    "@oneOf"    : [
        {
            "cat" : "Toy",
            "dog" : "Friend"
        },
        {
            "employers" : "xsd:positiveInteger",
            "unemployed": "xsd:string"
        },
    ]
}
```

#### Code: Examples of `@oneOf` class extensions

```json
{
    "@type": "IntOrString",
    "integer": 0
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "IntOrString",
    "string": "zero"
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "Pet",
    "cat": {
        "@type": "Toy",
        "name": "ball of string"
    },
    "employers": 5
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "Pet",
    "dog": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Jim"
    },
    "unemployed": "A house pet."
}
```

```json
{
    "@type": "Pet",
    "string": "zero"
}
```

But not:

```json
{
    "@type": "IntOrString",
    "integer": 0,
    "string": "zero"
}
```

### Class properties

All non-keywords are treated as properties of the class, with the form:

```text
<property> : <Class>
```

Or

```text
<property> : { "@type" : <TypeFamily>,  "@class" : <Class> }
```

#### Range classes

A range class is a concrete base type defined as any of the xsd types (see XSD), or a class defined in the current schema, including the current class.

In the example range class below, `first_name` and `last_name` are strings, `year_of_birth` is a year, and `friend` is any number of `Person` objects, in no particular order and without duplication. Also, see below [an example of a concrete set of documents](#codeanexampleofaconcretesetofdocuments) with this form.

#### Code: An example range class

```json
{
    "@type"         : "@context",
    "@schema"       : "http://example.com/people#",
    "@base"         : "http://example.com/people/"
}
{
    "@id"           : "Person",
    "@type"         : "Class",
    "@base"         : "Person/",
    "@key"          :
    {
        "@type"     : "Lexical",
        "@fields"   :
        [
            "first_name", "last_name"
        ]
    },
    "first_name"    : "xsd:string",
    "last_name"     : "xsd:string",
    "knows"         :
    {
        "@type"     : "Set",
        "@class"    : "Person"
    },
    "year_of_birth" : "xsd:gYear"
}
```

#### Code: An example of a concrete set of documents

```json
{
    "@type"         : "Person",
    "@id"           : "Person/Hasdrubal_Barca",
    "first_name"    : "Hasdrubal",
    "last_name"     : "Barca",
    "knows"         :

### JSON Types, sys:JSON and sys:JSONDocument

{% callout type="note" title="New feature!" %}
The `"sys:JSON"` and the type `"sys:JSONDocument"` types are now supported. This feature was marked as supported starting with TerminusDB 12.
{% /callout %}

Two special JSON types exist in TerminusDB. One is for use as field type, essentially a subdocument that is not schema checked, the `"sys:JSON"` data type, and the type `"sys:JSONDocument"` which is used for completely unstructured JSON document storage. Both allow un-constrained and non type-checked documents to be stored or retrieved as arbitrary JSON, yet indexed and searchable using WOQL.

#### ID handling for sys:JSON and sys:JSONDocument

IDs for subdocuments of type `"sys:JSON"` are formed from a hash of the content internally, meaning that subdocuments share reference-counted storage if their content is the same; via deduplication and reference counting, for efficient triple-based storage.

However, documents of type `"sys:JSONDocument"` are assigned a random id, such that they can be retrieved, modified etc. Alternatively they can be assigned an id by passing in an id of the form `{ "@id" : "JSONDocument/my_id_here", ...}`, where the `JSONDocument/` prefix makes JSON documents easy to recognize in the document graph database.

`@id`, `@type`, and some other JSON-LD control properties (such as `@context`, `@value`) in `sys:JSON` and `sys:JSONDocument` documents receive special treatment to not interfere with JSON-LD processing. They are escaped by prefixing with an additional `@` sign (e.g., `@id` → `@@id`, `@type` → `@@type`) within the triple store. This escaping is transparent in the document interfaces and happens automatically during storage and retrieval. It enables any JSON to be stored as a document, even if it contains JSON-LD control properties, and to be processed as triples.

**WOQL Limitation:** When using WOQL `insert_document` with `sys:JSON` fields containing `@`-prefixed properties, you must manually pre-escape them by using `@@` instead of `@` (e.g., `{"@@id": "value", "@@type": "Type"}`). This is because WOQL parses JSON-LD before type information is available and operates on the pure triples. The REST Document API handles this automatically and is recommended for handling such documents.

#### Code: An example of `"sys:JSON"`

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@schema"    : "http://example.com/people#",
    "@base"      : "http://example.com/people/"
}
{
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "metadata"   : "sys:JSON"
}
```

We can now have a well typed `"Person"` which contains a metadata field of type `"sys:JSON"` which is unconstrained JSON as follows:

```json
{
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John",
    "metadata": { "theme": "Dark", "last_visit": "10-01-02" }
}
```

#### Code: An example of `"sys:JSONDocument"`

Using the `{ "json" : true }` option to the insert API, or using the TerminusDB CLI with the `-j` or `--json=true` flag we can insert an arbitrary JSON document.

Using the CLI we can write:

```bash
echo '{ "size" : 12.0, "name" : "Bob" }' | terminusdb doc insert admin/example -j
Document inserted ["terminusdb:///json/JSONDocument/9cb4de0ff0b46b6035149a6b763e087d6c59cba2b417de3eedfd26063bee6bdf"]
```

## Type families

Use type families to construct optionality or collections of values. Type families are `List`, `Set`, `Array`, and `Optional`.

### Optional

Use `Optional` as a type family where a property is not required.

#### Code: An example of type family Optional

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@schema"    : "http://example.com/people#",
    "@base"      : "http://example.com/people/" }

{
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@id"        : "CodeBlock",
    "code"       : "xsd:string",
    "comment"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Optional",
        "@class" : "xsd:string"
    }
}
```

Supply an optional `comment` field in `CodeBlock`. Both of the following documents are valid:

```json
{
    "@type": "CodeBlock",
    "@id": "my_code_block",
    "code": "print('hello world')",
    "comment": "This is a silly bit of code"
}
```

OR

```json
{
    "@type": "CodeBlock",
    "@id": "my_code_block",
    "code": "print('hello world')"
}
```

### List

Use `List` to specify an ordered collection, with multiplicity, of values of a class or datatype.

#### Code: An example of type family List

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "TaskList",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "tasks"      :
    {
        "@type"  : "List",
        "@class" : "Task"
    }
}
{
    "@id"        : "Task",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "@key"       : "ValueHash",
    "name"       : "xsd:string"
}
```

An example of an object `Task` contained in a `List` of elements known as a `TaskList`. This list is retrieved in the same order that it is inserted. It is also capable of storing duplicates.

```json
{
    "@id": "my_task_list",
    "@type": "TaskList",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "@type": "Task",
            "name": "Laundry"
        },
        {
            "@type": "Task",
            "name": "Take_Garage_Out"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Set

Use `Set` to specify an unordered set of values of a class or datatype.

#### Code: An example of type family Set

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "friends"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Set",
        "@class" : "Person"
    }
}
```

An example of an object `Person` that can have 0 to any number of friends. This list has no order and is retrieved from the database in a potentially different order. Inserted duplicates do not create additional linkages and only a single of the multiple supplied results are returned.

```json
{
    "@id": "Me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "friends": [
        {
            "@type": "Person",
            "@id": "you",
            "name": "You"
        },
        {
            "@type": "Person",
            "@id": "someone_else",
            "name": "Someone Else"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Set with cardinality

Use `Set` to specify an unordered set of values of a class or datatype in which the property has a limited number of elements as specified by the cardinality constraint properties.

`Set` is functionally equivalent to the previously named multiplicity of `Cardinality`. `Cardinality` is now deprecated, and should be replaced with `Set`, using the cardinality constraint properties in the same way as with `Cardinality`.

The relevant properties on `Set` and `Cardinality` multiplicities are:

#### `@cardinality`

When specified, the number of elements for the given property must be _exactly_ the cardinality specified. This is equivalent to specifying both `@min_cardinality` and `@max_cardinality` as the same cardinality.

#### Code: An example of type family Set with `@cardinality`

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "friends"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Set",
        "@class" : "Person"
        "@cardinality" : 3
    }
}
```

An example of an object `Person` that can have exactly three friends. As with `Set` This list has no order and is retrieved from the database in a potentially different order.

```json
{
    "@id": "Person/Me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "friends": [
        {
            "@type": "Person",
            "@id": "Person/you",
            "name": "You"
        },
        {
            "@type": "Person",
            "@id": "Person/someone_else",
            "name": "Someone Else"
        },
        {
            "@type": "Person",
            "@id": "Person/Another",
            "name": "Another"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### `@min_cardinality`

When specified, the number of elements for the given property must be _at least_ the cardinality specified.

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "friends"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Set",
        "@class" : "Person"
        "@min_cardinality" : 1
    }
}
```

#### `@max_cardinality`

When specified, the number of elements for the given property must be _no more than_ the cardinality specified.

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "friends"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Set",
        "@class" : "Person"
        "@min_cardinality" : 1
    }
}
```

When set to 1, this is functionally equivalent to the `Optional` constraint.

### Array

Use `Array` to specify an ordered collection, with multiplicity, of values of a class or datatype in which you may want random access to the data and which may be multi-dimensional. `Array` is implemented with intermediate indexed objects, with a `sys:value` and indexes placed at `sys:index`, `sys:index2`, … `sys:indexN` for each of the array indices of the multi-dimensional array. However when extracted as JSON they will appear merely as lists (possibly of lists), with possible null values representing gaps in the array.

#### Code: An example of type family Array

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "GeoPolygon",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "coordinates"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Array",
        "@dimensions" : 2,
        "@class" : "xsd:decimal"
    }
}
```

An example of a polygon object `GeoPolygon` points to a 2D array of coordinates which specify a polygon encompassing the Phoneix Park.

```json
{
    "@id": "PhoenixPark",
    "@type": "GeoPolygon",
    "name": "The Pheonix Park",
    "coordinates": [
        [-6.3491535, 53.3700669],
        [-6.3364506, 53.3717056],
        [-6.349411, 53.3699645]
    ]
}
```

## Document type inferencing engine

TerminusDB is equipped with a type inference engine that allows types to be inferred under certain conditions.

The algorithm attempts to find a _unique_ type that can successfully be ascribed to a document. In the event that no type is found, you will get an error that no type applies. If _several_ types might apply, you will see the list of candidate types in the error. If TerminusX is able to find the unique type which applies, it will ascribe the type automatically.

Type ascription is perhaps most useful in cases in which abstract types are used as ranges of a property, but in which there are only _sibling_ concrete types that might apply. In this case, it is easy to ensure a unique typing for the range class and improves the flexibility of the interface.

It should also be considered that the type being ascribed is based on the schema _as it is_ when the document is inserted. For this reason, in some cases it may be better to tag the document explicitly with the `@type` keyword.

#### Code: An example of type inference

Given the following schema:

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@id"        : "Person",
    "@type"      : "Class",
    "name"       : "xsd:string",
    "friends"    :
    {
        "@type"  : "Set",
        "@class" : "Person"
    }
}
```

We can insert the following document through the document interface:

```json
{ "name": "Gavin", "friends": [{ "name": "Tim" }, { "name": "Julie" }] }
```

This document will be ascribed type `"Person"` and the two documents linked will likewise be typed as `"Person"`

#### Code: An example of unambiguous inference

In the case of certain well-defined JSON documents schemata however, such as GeoJSON, there is never a possibility of ambiguity and so the type-inferencing helps to make it much more convenient.

```json
{
    "@type"      : "@context",
    "@base"      : "http://i/",
    "@schema"    : "http://s/"
}
{
    "@type" : "Class",
    "@id" : "Geometry",
    "@abstract" : []
}
{
    "@type" : "Enum",
    "@id" : "Point_Type",
    "@value" : [ "Point" ]
}
{
    "@type" : "Class",
    "@id" : "Point",
    "@inherits" : "Geometry",
    "type" : "Point_Type",
    "coordinates" : {
        "@type" : "Array",
        "@dimensions" : 1,
        "@class" : "xsd:decimal"
    }
}
```

This schema provides the `"Point"` type with a singleton enum tag. This singleton enum tag will help to uniquely assign the type.

We can then insert a point document which might be written as:

```json
{
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [33.2, 24.0]
}
```
